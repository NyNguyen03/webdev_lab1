  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Ny Nguyen, and I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science major and am pursuing a coterminal master's degree in Cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>I enjoy traveling, and my goal is to visit all the states in the United States. So far, I have only been to a few places such as Ohio, Texas, Georgia, New York and California.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and playing badminton with my friends.</p>
